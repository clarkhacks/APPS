#2: Live*
#2: That is my normal earnings plus what ill make this month due to shut down
#1: That's not her fault but start drawing in on all assets
#2: Im literally fucked
#1: You dont have savings set up?
#2: I cant really save anything woth 2 people out of a job and me paying for everything can i?
#1: Anything counts. I thought Cody worked
and Troy
#2: Nope, cody quit awhile bacl and troy quit awhile back too
#1: Why did they quit
#2: I mean codys gonna go talk to the hiring manager amd ask for a second chance
#1: Why are they living with you ifyoure paying everything
#1: So he quit...without another job linedup..?
#2: Troy on the other hand got hired at chick filÃ© the other day
#2: But i wont be getting grocery money out of him at all
#1: Why
#2: He never helps with them
#1: Then dont feed him
#2: He sneaks shit
#2: But either way im fucked
#1: talk to him about it
#2: We have
#2: It doesnt worl
#2: But yeah nicole wont lower my car payment so i wont be able to pay my water bill
#1: That's not her fault. You initially told her you could manage that payment.
#1: Skip wifi or something over water
#2: No she said i could
#2: And THEN i took a paycut
#2: And i cant because the Wi-Fi bill isnt duw
#2: And my check is only 219
#1: Work two jobs, make your roomies payup, drop wifi, drop tv if you have it, anything you dont need get rid of as a bill. Watch electrical usage, dont eat out, dont just buy food buy planned meals.
#1: Otherwise Idk what to tell you
#2: I could have afforded it if i were making my normal pay of 310 a week
#2: And NOWHERE WILL HIRE ME
#1: but still. cut out everything you dont need for the next few months. save up a few thousand and then get it back
#1: Thats tough shit. Getting a job is hard
#2: ive applied and applied and applied
#2: Amd i got 1 fucking interview and the manager was a CUNT
#2: i didnt even get an actual interview even though i was nice as hell
#2: And i cant skip over a Payment that isnt even due
#2: The only things due are my water and car bill
#1: I mean for the next few months do that until you have a few months of payments saved up
#2: And dude i wont even have 1000 save up in a year. My internet is 20 a month. #2: And i dont have tv.
#2: I have movies
#2: And the laat time i wemt out to eat i spent 5 dollars on a pizza
#1: Dont eat out, drop wifi, do what you need to save save save. every single penny.
#1: I had a jar or change that I saved for a month. I went to cash it today. I got 46 bucks. from loose change I otherwise wouldve lost
#2: And it is her fault. Its her fault for making my payment as high as it was even though i didnt want it that high but she did it anyways, and because of that i cant save anything, and now she wont lower it when i cant afford it, and you know what its gonna fuck both me and her in the end so whatever
#1: You cant blame her for it. It's yourlife you steer the ship Haily. Be a penny pincher, clip coupons, cut out everything that isnt neccessary right now so you dont get billed for another month. Save whatver the hell you can
#2: I have nothing to save
#2: Do you not get that?
#2: I cant even change my cars oil
#1: There is always somethin to save. Even joe and dad are agreeing right now.
#2: Even if i cut out wifi thats my oil change money.
#2: Shit no one gives a flying fuck about me ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ i literally have nothing
#1: Cut out the wifi and do the oil then
#1: Thats a start
#2: I cant
#2: I CANT
#2: Im obly getting payed 3 times this month
#2: Even if i cut out the fucking internet id still be in the negatives
#1: But you'll save next week
#1: Apply for a credit card
#2: And have more bills?
#2: And what about my 75 court payment
#2: I didn't include that
#1: Court for what
#2: My speeding ticket i got a few months ago because i was being chased down the freeway by some paychotic cunt in a blue chrysler van
#1: That's your fault
#1: Not theirs
#2: Your not making me feel any better. I know thats my fucking fault. Im already having a psychotic break amd your just pointing out shit thats making me feel even worse
#1: Well everything you've said so far is what you've done to yourself. You can either worry now and suffer twice. Or handle it and suffer once.</textarea><br/><a class="button" id="build" href="#">Build</a><br/><br/>
